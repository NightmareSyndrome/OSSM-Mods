# 3D Printed Parts for the OSSM

These parts have been designed or modded by the [KinkyMakers Discord community.](https://discord.gg/MmpT9xE) 

Generally, you can print these parts with 6 walls and 20% gyroid infill unless otherwise noted. Structural parts should be printed at 90% infill. 

I have organized these in folders as they relate to different parts of the OSSM.
