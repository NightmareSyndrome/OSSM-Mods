# A larger tie down

The tiedown that came with the OSSM kit from research and desire was not large enough to fit many of the toys that we have, so I remixed the tie down. This version is larger and has deeper grooves so the tie does not slip. There are also embedded holes that keep toys in place extremely well.

I also wanted a more hygienic solution as rope was next to impossible to clean. 
The holes perfectly accomodate latex tubing which makes strapping a toy down very easy. Spring toggles help to keep the latex tube in place. Both are very common and easy to get and cheap!
